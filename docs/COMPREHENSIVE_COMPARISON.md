## Gaps in Existing Tools (Research-Based)

### Gap 1: No ISO 31000 Framework
**Problem**: All commercial tools focus on vulnerability scanning, not comprehensive risk management.

**Research**: ISO 31000:2018 standard

**Impact**: Organizations seeking ISO 31000 compliance cannot use these tools.

**GRC Solution**: ✅ Complete implementation of all ISO 31000 phases

---

### Gap 2: Lack of Probabilistic Modeling
**Problem**: Risk assessment is deterministic without handling uncertainty.

**Research**: 
- Parviainen et al. (2021) - "Implementing Bayesian Networks for ISO 31000:2018"
- ScienceDirect: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231221001673

**Impact**: Cannot model risk dependencies or uncertainty.

**GRC Solution**: ✅ Bayesian Network module for complex scenarios

---

### Gap 3: Binary Risk Assessment
**Problem**: Simple high/low risk without nuanced evaluation.

**Research**:
- Luo (2023) - "Fuzzy Logic and Neural Network-based Risk Assessment"
- BonView Press: https://www.bonviewpress.com/article/doi/10.47852/bonviewAIA3202905

**Impact**: Cannot handle imprecise risk information.

**GRC Solution**: ✅ Fuzzy Logic with linguistic variables

---

### Gap 4: Signature-Based Only
**Problem**: Cannot detect zero-day or unknown threats.

**Research**: Multiple ML surveys show signature limitations

**Impact**: Misses sophisticated attacks.

**GRC Solution**: ✅ ML-based behavioral analysis (4 models)

---

### Gap 5: No Predictive Analytics
**Problem**: Point-in-time assessment without forecasting.

**Research**:
- Burstein et al. (2023) - "Deconstructing Risk Factors for Predicting"
- MDPI: https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/4/871

**Impact**: Reactive rather than proactive security.

**GRC Solution**: ✅ Predictive analytics with trend analysis

---

### Gap 6: Limited OSINT Integration
**Problem**: Internal scanning without external threat context.

**Research**:
- Wiradarma et al. (2019) - "IT Risk Management using OSINT"
- MECS Press: http://www.mecs-press.org/ijcnis/ijcnis-v11-n12/v11n12-4.html

**Impact**: Missing external threat intelligence.

**GRC Solution**: ✅ OSINT capability

---

### Gap 7: ML Vulnerability
**Problem**: ML models can be manipulated by adversarial attacks.

**Research**:
- Ibitoye et al. (2019) - "The Threat of Adversarial Attacks on ML"
- arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02621

**Impact**: ML-based tools can be fooled.

**GRC Solution**: ✅ Adversarial-robust training

---

### Gap 8: Generic Remediation
**Problem**: Vague recommendations without actionable details.

**Research**: Industry analysis and user feedback

**Impact**: Security teams struggle with implementation.

**GRC Solution**: ✅ Detailed plans with timelines and costs

---
